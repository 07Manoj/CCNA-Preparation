# CCNA-Preparation
These is my preparation to achieve the Cisco Certified Network Associate Certification and learn Networking.

All of my notes and packet tracer lab packets are created as a process of my learning from different resources and I would like to mention that I have been studying from the Cisco Official Certification Guide. Some of the images are snapshots from the book and the credit goes to the author.
